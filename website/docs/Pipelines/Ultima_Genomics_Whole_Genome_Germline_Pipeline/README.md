## Introduction to the UG_WGS workflow

The [Ultima Genomics WholeGenome Germline (UG_WGS) workflow](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/ugwgs/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline.wdl) is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow for processing whole-genome germline sequencing data generated using the Ultima Genomics sequencing platform. Ultima Genomics sequencing is a novel technology that produces single-read, flow-based data.

The workflow requires either an aligned CRAM output of the sequencing platform or an unmapped BAM as input. Overall, it aligns reads to a reference genome, marks duplicate reads, calls variants, post-processes variants in the output VCF in preparation for joint calling, and calculates quality control metrics. The workflow outputs a (re)aligned CRAM, an annotated GVCF with index, and quality metrics.

## UG_WGS tasks and tools

The [UG_WGS workflow](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/ugwgs/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline.wdl) imports additional WDL scripts that contain the different workflow tasks. When applicable, links are provided to the summary section below. To see specific tool parameters, select the task WDL link in the table; then find the task and view the `command {}` section of the task in the WDL script. To view or use the exact tool software, see the task's Docker image which is specified in the task WDL `input {}` section as `String docker =`.

Overall, the UG_WGS workflow:
1. Aligns with BWA mem and marks duplicates.
1. Converts a merged BAM to CRAM and validates the CRAM.
1. Extracts the nucleotide flow order.
1. Variant calls with HaplotypeCaller.
1. Merges BAMs and converts the GVCF to VCF.
1. Performs VCF post-processing in preparation for joint calling.
1. Calculates quality control metrics.



#### 1. Align and mark duplicates

**Task name and WDL link:**[UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineAlignmentMarkDuplicates.AlignmentAndMarkDuplicates as AlignmentAndMarkDuplicates](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineAlignmentMarkDuplicates.wdl)

The table below details the subtasks called by the AlignmentAndMarkDuplicates task, which splits the CRAM or BAM into subfiles, converts them to uBAM format, filters by RSQ value, converts the uBAM to FASTQ for alignment with BWA mem, and marks duplicate reads in the resulting BAM files. 

The Picard tool MarkDuplicates has been adapted to handle ambiguity in the aligned start of a read.

| Subtask name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Tasks.SplitCram as SplitInputCram](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | split | crammer | If CRAM is the workflow input, splits the CRAM and outputs a split CRAM. |
| [AlignmentTasks.SamSplitter as SplitInputBam](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Alignment.wdl) | SplitSamByNumberOfReads | Picard | If BAM is workflow input, splits the BAM and outputs an array of BAMs |
| [Tasks.ConvertCramOrBamToUBam as ConvertToUbam](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | view, RevertSam | samtools, Picard | Converts the split CRAM or BAM file to uBAM. |
| [Tasks.FilterByRsq](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | filter | bamtools | Filters each split uBAM by the predefined RSQ threshold and outputs a new filtered uBAM. |
| [Tasks.SamToFastqAndBwaMemAndMba](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | SamToFastq, bwa mem, MergeBamAlignment | Picard, bwa mem  | Converts each uBAM to FASTQ format, aligns with BWA mem, and merges the alignment in the resulting BAM with metadata from the uBAM. |
| [Tasks.MarkDuplicatesSpark](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | MarkDuplicatesSpark | GATK | Flags duplicate reads in the array of aligned and merged BAMs to create a new output BAM and index. |

#### 2. Convert BAM to CRAM and validate the CRAM
The two tasks below are used to convert each duplicate-marked BAM to CRAM and validate the resulting files.

| TASK name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Utilities.ConvertToCram](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Utilities.wdl) | view | samtools | Converts the duplicated-marked BAM to CRAM. |
| QC.ValidateSamFile as ValidateCram](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Qc.wdl) | ValidateSamFile | Picard | Validates the CRAM file. |


#### 3. Extract nucleotide flow order
The flow order is the order in which nucleotides are passed during sequencing. This information is captured in the header of the BAM and is extracted as a text file for downstream processing.

| TASK name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Tasks.ExtractSampleNameFlowOrder](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | GetSampleName | GATK | Extracts the flow order from the BAM header into a text file that is used in downstream VCF post-processing. |

#### 4. Variant call with HaplotypeCaller

The workflow implements initial variant calling with a version of HaplotypeCaller that handles flow-based data. This version replaces the classic Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a flow-based likelihood model that more accurately accounts for sequencing errors present in the data.

| Task name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Utilities.ScatterIntervalList](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Utilities.wdl) | IntervalListTools | Picard | Splits the calling interval_list into sub-intervals in order to perform variant calling on the sub-intervals |
| [Tasks.HaplotypeCaller](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | HaplotypeCaller | GATK | Performs initial variant calls and  outputs sub-interval GVCFs and bamout. |

#### 5. Merge VCFs and BAMs and convert GVCF to VCF 
To prepare the VCF for downstream joint calling, the workflow performs multiple post-processing steps. The HaplotypeCaller GVCF outputs are merged into a single GVCF and then converted to VCF in preparation for post-processing.

| Task name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [VariantDiscoverTasks.MergeVCFs](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/GermlineVariantDiscovery.wdl) | Merges the array of GVCFs from HaplotypeCaller into one VCF and index. | MergeVcfs | Picard |
| [Tasks.MergeBams](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | MergeSamFiles | Picard | Merges the HaplotypeCaller bamouts into a single BAM file. |
| [Tasks.ConvertGVCFtoVCF](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | GenotypeGVCFs | GATK | Converts to GVCF to VCF format in preparation for post-processing. |

#### 6. Perform VCF post-processing
The workflow performs post-processing steps to prepare the VCF for downstream joint calling. First, it annotates the merged HaplotypeCaller output VCF with dbSNP variants, then it trains a model to distinguish between true positive variants and false positives. Next, the model is applied to filter variants in the VCF.

| Task name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Tasks.AnnotateVCF](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | VariantAnnotator | GATK | Adds dbSNP annotations to the HaplotypeCaller output VCF and outputs a new VCF with index. |
| [Tasks.AddIntervalAnnotationsToVCF](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | annotate | bcftools | Adds additional interval annotations to the VCF. |
| [Tasks.TrainModel](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | Custom script (train_models_pipeline.py) | genomics.py3 | Trains a model that can be applied for variant filtering to distinguish true and false-positive variants. |
| [Tasks.AnnotateVCF_AF](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | view, index | vcfanno, bcftools | Adds gnomAD allele frequencies to the VCF for downstream metric calculation. |
| [Tasks.FilterVCF](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | filter_variants_pipeline.py | genomics.py3 | Applies a trained model to filter for high quality VCF variants. |
| [Tasks.MoveAnnotationsToGvcf](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | annotate | bcftools | Produces a final post-processed GVCF and index. |


#### 7. Calculate quality control metrics

**Task name and WDL link:**[UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineQC.UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineQC as CollectStatistics](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineQC.wdl)

The workflow uses a contamination estimation that has been adapted to use only the highest quality SNP sites based on flow cycles and local realignment. This is different from the [Whole Genome Germline Single Sample](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Whole_Genome_Germline_Single_Sample_Pipeline/README/) pipeline in that HaplotypeCaller performs local realignment and feeds that output to VerifyBAM ID, which cleans up the alignment.

| Subtask name and WDL link | Tool | Software | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Tasks.HaplotypeCaller as HaplotypeCallerForContamination](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | HaplotypeCaller | GATK | Runs HaplotypeCaller using an interval list of variants with high allele frequencies (`contamination_sites_vcf`). |
| [Tasks.CheckContamination](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | VerifyBamID | VerifyBamID | Checks contamination in the HaplotypeCallerForContamination bamout. |
| [Tasks.CollectDuplicateMetrics](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | CollectDuplicateMetrics | Picard | Checks duplication metrics in the aggregated, duplicate-marked BAM file. | 
| [QC.CollectQualityYieldMetrics](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Qc.wdl) | CollectQualityYieldMetrics | Picard | Calculates QC metrics on the duplicated-marked BAM. |

| [Tasks.CollectRawWgsMetrics](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | CollectRawWgsMetrics | Picard | Collects the raw WGS metrics on the duplicated-marked BAM with commonly used QC metrics. |
| [Tasks.CollectAggregationMetrics](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermlineTasks.wdl) | CollectMultipleMetrics | Picard | Performs QC on the aligned, duplicated-marked BAM.| 
| [QC.CheckPreValidation](https://github.com/Ultimagen/warp-private/blob/jukebox-refactor/tasks/broad/Qc.wdl) | custom script | python3 | Checks chimerism and duplicate files for a given threshold using a custom python script. |
